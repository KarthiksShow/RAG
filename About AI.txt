Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include understanding language, recognizing patterns, solving problems, and making decisions. AI systems are trained using large amounts of data and algorithms to learn how to respond intelligently. Today, AI is used in many fields such as healthcare, finance, education, and transportation.
